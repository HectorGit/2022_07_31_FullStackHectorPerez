# What I added in this version : 

I used the Material-UI library to display the data in a more aesthetic way

I used the data in the Redux Store to render the data

I added a text field that would allow the user to change the desired city to fetch data weather for

I modified the button to instead dispatch an action that would update the city requested in the Redux store

# What I would do if I had more time : 

I would investigate how to make the Apollo GraphQL query re-run upon updating the city requested in the Redux store
